Scaling multiplies the distances from the co-ordinate axes by a constant factor. The scaling matrix which scales by v<sup>x</sup>, v<sup>y</sup> and v<sup>z</sub> units looks like:

On multiplication with a vector, the expected result is obtained:

A scaling transformation can also be interpreted as resizing the co-ordinate axes while keeping the points constant. Thus, a scaling by (2,3) will require redrawing each unit on the X-axis as 2 units and each unit on the Y-axis as 3.
